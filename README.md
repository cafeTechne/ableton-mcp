# Antigravity Ableton MCP (Windows/Codex Edition)

> **Note**: While this project was originally forked from [ahujasid/ableton-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp), it has been **completely re-architected** into a comprehensive production system.
>
> We have moved far beyond the original proof-of-concept, expanding the codebase by orders of magnitude to create an **actually useful tool for serious musicians**. This is not just a playback controller; it is an AI co-producer capable of understanding music theory, complex routing, and deep structural arrangement.

This project is specifically designed for:
*   **VS Code** with the **Codex** extension, or
*   **Google Antigravity** (the VS Code fork)

It connects **Ableton Live 11** to your agent using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), unlocking the full depth of the Live 11 API through a modular, robust backend.

## 🚀 The "Antigravity" Difference

The difference between this and the original repo is night and day:

### 1. From "Toy" to "Production Workbench"
*   **Complete Overhaul**: The original codebase was a lightweight experiment for Mac. This is a robust system optimized for Windows.
*   **Modular Architecture**: No monoliths. The system is cleanly separated:
    *   `MCP_Server/` (RPC layer)
    *   `mcp_tooling/` (Logic, Theory, Device Management)
    *   `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/handlers/` (21 specialized API handler modules)
*   **Musician-Centric**: Every tool was redesigned with production workflow in mind—solving real problems like sidechain routing, precise EQing, and complex rack management.

### 2. Deep Live 11 API Integration
*   The original touched the surface; **we have mapped 220+ MCP tools** covering the entirety of the Live 11 API.
*   **Explicit Implementation**: The API is not "guessed" by the AI. It is explicitly written into 21 handler modules in our Remote Script (e.g., `handlers/device.py` at 66KB, `handlers/track.py` at 101KB).
*   **Robust Networking**: Rebuilt the socket communication layer from scratch to handle heavy data loads.

### 3. Agentic Music Theory Core
This is the biggest addition. The agent now "knows" music:
*   **Advanced Chord Progressions**: Understands functional harmony (Key, Scale, Mood, Voice Leading, Inversions).
*   **Intelligent Basslines**: Walking, Funk, Rock, Reggae styles that follow chord changes.
*   **Orchestration Modules**: Dedicated generators for Strings, Woodwinds, and Brass with genre profiles.
*   **Rhythm & Groove**: A **4.2MB library of drum patterns** covering house, hiphop, techno, jazz, and more.
*   **Song Blueprints**: Can scaffold entire song arrangements from a simple prompt.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

*   **Ableton Live 11** (Suite suggested for full API access)
*   **Windows 10/11**
*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **VS Code** with **Codex** extension, or **Google Antigravity**
*   [`uv`](https://astral.sh/uv) package manager (installed and on PATH)

### Python Dependencies

This project requires two Python packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `mcp[cli]>=1.3.0` | Model Context Protocol library |
| `fastmcp` | FastMCP framework for tool definitions |

**Install with uv (recommended):**
```bash
cd ableton-mcp
uv sync
```

**Or with pip:**
```bash
pip install mcp[cli]>=1.3.0 fastmcp
```

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Install the Remote Script
You can install the script manually or use our deployment tool.

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
Run the deploy script from the repo root:
```powershell
python scripts/deploy.py
# Or, clear cached .pyc files first:
python scripts/deploy.py --clean
```
*This will automatically find your User Library and install/update the script.*

**Option B: Manual**
1.  Close Ableton Live.
2.  Navigate to: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\`
3.  Copy the `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script` folder from this repo into that location.

### 2. Configure Ableton Live
1.  Launch Ableton Live (or Relaunch it to ensure the script is loaded if it was running when you ran deploy.py).
2.  Go to **Options > Preferences > Link, Tempo & MIDI**.
3.  In the **Control Surface** list, find and select **AbletonMCP_Remote_Script**.
4.  Set **Input** and **Output** to **None**.
5.  *Verification*: You should see a status message in the bottom bar: `"AbletonMCP: Listening for commands..."`

### 3. Configure MCP Server
Add the following to your MCP settings configuration (e.g., in VS Code's `settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ableton-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "C:\\path\\to\\this\\repo",
        "ableton-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
*Replace `C:\\path\\to\\this\\repo` with the actual absolute path.*

### 4. OpenWebUI Integration (SSE)

This server supports **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for integration with OpenWebUI or other web-based clients.

1.  **Start the Server Manually:**
    ```powershell
    # Standard installation
    python MCP_Server/server.py --transport sse --port 8000

    # Or via uv
    uv run ableton-mcp --transport sse
    ```

2.  **Configure OpenWebUI:**
    *   Navigate to **Admin Panel > Settings > External Connections**.
    *   Add a new MCP Server.
    *   **URL:** `http://host.docker.internal:8000/sse` (if OpenWebUI is in Docker) or `http://localhost:8000/sse`.

3.  **Note:** The default behavior (running without arguments) remains `stdio` for compatibility with Claude Desktop.

## ⚠️ Critical Gotchas for Agents

These are documented in `AGENTS.md` but are important enough to highlight:

| Problem | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|:---|:---|:---|
| EQ Frequency | `freq=180` (Hz) | `freq=0.299` (normalized) |
| EQ Gain | `gain=-3` (dB) | `gain=0.4` (normalized) |
| Track Detection | Hardcoded indices | Use `get_song_context` first! |

**Conversion Formulas:**
```python
# EQ Frequency (10 Hz - 22 kHz, logarithmic)
norm = log(freq_hz / 10) / log(2200)

# EQ Gain (-15 dB to +15 dB, linear)
norm = (db + 15) / 30
```

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

Run the doctor script from the repo root:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/doctor.ps1
```
This verifies: `uv`/Python availability, Remote Script folder, and TCP port status.

### Common Issues
*   **Connection Failed**: Ensure Ableton is running and the control surface is selected.
*   **No Sound / EQ Silence**: You likely sent raw Hz/dB values instead of normalized values.
*   **Script Not Loading After Changes**: After editing `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script`, you must restart Ableton completely (just toggling the control surface is NOT enough).

## 🧪 Experimental: Local LLM & OpenWebUI Integration

For developers wanting to move away from cloud tokens or work offline, this server supports **Local LLM integration via OpenWebUI and Ollama**.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental Status**: While the connectivity works, running complex **agentic systems** (which require following the 30+ workflows and `AGENTS.md`) requires significant local compute. Small models like Gemma 3 4B may struggle with the sheer volume of tool definitions (220+) and logic.

### 💻 Hardware Recommendations
- **RAM**: 32GB+ (128GB recommended for running high-quality 32B+ parameter models on CPU).
- **GPU**: 8GB+ VRAM recommended. For AMD users, ensure you use the latest Ollama (v0.12.11+) with **Vulkan** support enabled (`$env:OLLAMA_VULKAN=1`).

### 🛠 setup
1.  **Install Ollama**: Version 0.12.11 or later for Vulkan/GPU acceleration.
2.  **Install MCPO Proxy**: This bridges the MCP SSE server to an OpenAPI format OpenWebUI understands.
    ```bash
    pip install mcpo
    ```
3.  **Add Firewall Rules** (Administrator PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MCP Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MCPO Proxy" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8001
    ```

### 🚀 Launching the Stack
Use the provided `start_openwebui_mcp.bat` in the project root to launch both the MCP Server (Port 8000) and the MCPO Proxy (Port 8001) simultaneously.

### 🌐 OpenWebUI Configuration
1.  Navigate to **Workspace > Tools > Add Tool (+)**.
2.  **Type**: OpenAPI
3.  **URL**: `http://host.docker.internal:8001` (if using Docker) or `http://localhost:8001`.
4.  **OpenAPI Spec**: `openapi.json`
5.  **Auth**: No authentication.

Once added, select the **Ableton Tools** in your model's workspace settings to give it control over your DAW.
