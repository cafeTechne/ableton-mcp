Capture currently playing clips and insert them as a new scene after the selected scene. Raises a runtime error if creating a new scene would exceed the limitations.
Capture recently played MIDI material from audible tracks. If no Destination is given or Destination is set to CaptureDestination.auto, the captured material is inserted into the Session or Arrangement depending on which is visible. If Destination is set to CaptureDestination.session or CaptureDestination.arrangement, inserts the material into Session or Arrangement, respectively. Raises a limitation error when capturing into the Session and a new scene would have to be created but can’t because it would exceed the limitations.

Duplicate a clip and put it into the next free slot and return the index of the destination slot. A new scene is created if no free slot is available. If creating the new scene would exceed the limitations, a runtime error is raised.
Duplicate the given clip into the arrangement of this track at the provided destination time and return it. When the type of the clip and the type of the track are incompatible, a runtime error is raised.
Duplicate the notes in the specified region to the destination_time. Only notes of the specified pitch are duplicated or all if pitch is -1. If the transposition_amount is not 0, the notes in the region will be transposed by the transpose_amount of semitones.Raises an error on audio clips.

Duplicates a scene and selects the new one. Raises a limitation error if creating a new scene would exceed the limitations.
Duplicates a track and selects the new one. If the track is inside a folded group track, the group track is unfolded. Raises a limitation error if creating a new track would exceed the limitations.
Duplicates the slot’s clip to the passed in target slot. Overrides the target’s clip if it’s not empty. Raises an exception if the (source) slot itself is empty, or if source and target have different track types (audio vs. MIDI). Also raises if the source or target slot is in a group track (so called group slot).

Expects a list of notes as returned from get_notes_extended. The content of the list will be used to modify existing notes in the clip, based on matching note IDs. This function should be used when modifying existing notes, e.g. changing the velocity or start time. The function ensures that per-note events attached to the modified notes are preserved. This is NOT the case when replacing notes via a combination of remove_notes_extended and add_new_notes. The given list can be a subset of the notes in the clip, but it must not contain any notes that are not present in the clip.
Expects a Python iterable holding a number of Live.Clip.MidiNoteSpecification objects. The objects will be used to construct new notes in the clip.

When a cue is selected, it gets deleted. If no cue is selected, a new cue is created at the current global songtime.
When set to true, slices can be added in slicing mode by playing notes .that are not assigned to slices, yet.
When the Song is playing, set the playing-position quantized to this Cuepoint’s time. When not playing, simply move the start playing position.
Will notify if the clip gets his first envelope or the last envelope is removed.
